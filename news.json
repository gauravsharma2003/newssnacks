    "rawdes": "Christopher Nolan is currently busy with the shoot of his next film The Odyssey. Several pictures of the shoot emerged on the internet, where the director was seen with Tom Holland and other extras dressed as warriors on a boat in Greece. The shoot took place on a wooden ship in the sea outside of Methoni, Greece. A fan took to Instagram to share how impressive it is that Nolan chose to film in a live location when he could have easily taken the easy route and done it inside a studio with green screens instead. (Also read: Leaked pics from Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey set reveal Tom Holland's look; internet spots historical inaccuracies)Christopher Nolan shoots The OdysseyA fan took to Instagram to comment on Nolan's decision to shoot The Odyssey on location and said, \u201cIt is rare to see things like this in modern movie blockbusters. If you notice anything about these pictures, they have no green screens! No CGI! This man built a boat, put it in the ocean and filmed scenes! With the film reportedly having a 250 million budget, stuff like this is so unheard of nowadays. They would normally build a boat and stick it in front of a green screen. This is why Christopher Nolan is one of the goats (Greatest of all time). If it really is true that the entirety of the film is going to be shot on location. It does seem that the 6/6 cyclops puppet bits are going to be filmed in Nestors Cave in Greece? It is why his movies are so f***ing fantastic!\u201dHe added, \u201cI cannot wait to see what story Nolan is going to tell with these backdrops! The set photos look like there are some extras in their armour and it just looks glorious. Take a look at Tom Holland in costume! I don't care what you say but the more and more things I see and hear about this, it may just be the greatest film of this century.\u201dMore reactionsReacting to the post, many more fans joined in the conversation in the comments section. One said, \u201cI love Nolan\u2019s practical effects and barely any use of CGI or green screen.\u201d A second fan noted, \u201cNolan movies are one of few worth going to theaters for.\u201d A comment read, \u201cThat's what happens when you properly use your budget, with people who are passionate about the art.\u201dThe all-star Universal Pictures production is an adaptation of Homer's Greek epic poem. It features an ensemble cast which includes Matt Damon, Tom Holland, Zendaya, Robert Pattinson, Lupita Nyong'o, Anne Hathaway, Charlize Theron, and Benny Safdie. The Odyssey is scheduled for release on July 17, 2026.",

During the 1980s and 1990s, legends such as Wasim Akram, Saeed Anwar, Waqar Younis, Shoaib Akhtar, Shahid Afridi, Javed Miandad, and Saqlain Mushtaq struck fear into the hearts of international teams \u2013 particularly arch-rivals India. These players defined an era of dominance, but over time, cricket\u2019s prominence in Pakistan has steadily declined, and the evidence is unmistakable.The national team\u2019s recent performances paint a grim picture of inconsistency. Early exits in the group stages of the 2023 ODI World Cup, the 2024 T20 World Cup, and now the Champions Trophy underscore this downward trend. A home Test series defeat to Bangladesh further exposed the team\u2019s struggles. While a Test series victory against England on home soil offers a rare bright spot, even that triumph was overshadowed by a last-minute decision to alter the pitch conditions \u2013 a move that raised more questions than it answered.The Pakistan cricket team\u2019s lacklustre performances have cast a harsh spotlight on the administrators of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Over the past three to four years, the PCB has experienced a revolving door of leadership, with multiple individuals stepping into the chairman\u2019s role. Notable names like Ramiz Raja, Najam Sethi, Zaka Ashraf, and Mohsin Naqvi have each taken their turn at the helm of this prestigious position, yet stability remains elusive.Ehsan Mani, who served as PCB chairman from 2018 to 2021, offered his perspective on the situation in an interview with Hindustan Times. He emphasised that Pakistan is not lacking in talent; rather, the key lies in bringing order to the cricketing ecosystem. According to Mani, the potential is there.

    "rawdes": "Rohit Sharma is likely to continue as India's Test captain for the upcoming five-match series in England, according to a report from the Indian Express. The Indian captain recently led India to a brilliant win in the Champions Trophy, where India beat New Zealand in the final in Dubai, and it seems Rohit's captaincy has impressed the board, winning its faith to continue leading the side in the longest format.The U-turn over Rohit's captaincy is interesting, considering a string of India's underwhelming performances at home and away in the red-ball format over the past few months. India faced a 0-3 loss to New Zealand at home, and failed to win a single match under Rohit's captaincy in Australia.The report from Indian Express states that Rohit's tactical acumen and leadership experience seem to have been the key factors in the decision. Despite India having a rich pool of top-order batters, the selectors believe there is no immediate successor who matches Rohit's strategic expertise.His ability to handle pressure, manage bowlers effectively, and set precise fields played a significant role in winning over the decision-makers. The report states that Rohit's captaincy at the Champions Trophy, where he shuffled the spinners brilliantly and forced the opposition batters into submission, impressed the BCCI.The board has also recognized that playing in England requires patience, adaptability, and an understanding of how to control the game\u2019s tempo \u2013 the qualities that Rohit, the BCCI believes, has exhibited in recent white-ball success.Lack of captaincy candidates?It is also believed that while India has a quality batting order, they are currently short of captaincy candidates. While the likes of Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant are relatively inexperienced to lead a side in Tests, KL Rahul's constant shuffling in the batting order, as well as his competition for spots with Pant, makes him an unsettling option.Jasprit Bumrah has led the Indian team in Rohit's absence, but his persistent issues with injuries may have also forced BCCI's hand.The decision to persist with Rohit also means that speculations will be put to rest throughout the IPL season, and India will have a clarity in their plan of action for the five-Test series against England. India last won a Test series in England in 2007 under Rahul Dravid's leadership, and came closest to beat the side in its own den during the 2021/22 tour.While India led the series 2-1 before the fifth Test was postponed due to Covid-19, Ben Stokes' men eventually equalised the series next year.",

Additionally, it aids your weight loss journey, boosting fitness levels and life expectancy.Also Read | Nutritionist reveals how never drinking alcohol has helped her skin and health, how it affects your body10k steps to lose 9 kgIn a video shared by Vimal Rajput, a nutritionist and fitness coach, she revealed how walking 10,000 steps helped her lose almost 20 lb, approximately 9 kg, in 3 months. She titled the clip, \u201cStop sleeping on 10,000 steps\u2026I am down 20 pounds in 3 months.\u201dPer Rajput's post, after a year of trial and error - where she tried HIIT cardio workouts and Yoyo dieting (also known as weight cycling, it is a pattern of losing weight, regaining it and then dieting again) - she found that walking was a sustainable approach to weight loss. \u201c[It] can help you lose 10 -20 pounds in 9-12 weeks and achieve that toned look where you feel confident, your clothes fit better, and you feel comfortable in your body more than ever,\u201d she wrote.A step-by-step planWhile walking will aid your transformation journey, it won't solely fix all your health problems. You have to combine 10k steps with a constructive plan that helps you shed the kilos. Here's what the nutritionist suggested:Flexible diet plan1. A slight calorie deficit to lose fat without feeling deprived.2. A protein-high diet, enough to preserve and build muscle.3. Enough fats to maintain hormone health.4. Carbs to enjoy the food you love.Structured workout plan customised to your realistic schedule1. Per Rajput, this depends on what equipment is available, including dumbbells, resistance bands, barbells, and other gym equipment. If you don't have the equipment available, you can start with your body weight.2. Your schedule and how much time you realistically have for workouts.3. Progressive overload to build strength and muscle, even in a calorie deficit.The nutritionist claimed that you don\u2019t need calories to lose your first 10-20 pounds. All you need to do is consistently walk 8-12k steps/day. \u201cIf your job requires sitting most of the day, I highly recommend investing in a walking pad. It\u2019s been one of my best investments ever,\u201d she added.Bulletproof accountability\u201cLife happens, works get busy, kids need you, and social events pop up. Accountability ensures you know what to do, how to stay consistent and how to get unstuck when you hit a plateau,\u201d she explained.\u201cTruth is, I couldn\u2019t lose weight and sustain it until I mastered these 3 steps. I used to feel stuck - cutting sugar, bread, rice, and carbs while doing endless cardio and random workouts and yet I still couldn\u2019t achieve the toned look I wanted. But when I went all in with the right plan and execution, I unlocked a lifestyle that allowed me to get my dream body while actually enjoying my life,\u201d she concluded.Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

The ace pacer, who suffered from back spasm during the first innings of the Sydney Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy earlier this year, has been undergoing rehabilitation for stress in his back.

Their first home game is scheduled for March 31 against Kolkata Knight Riders.While there is hope that Bumrah could be available for that fixture, it is not a certainty. He might join the MI camp earlier, but it appears unlikely that he will travel to Chennai and Ahmedabad with the squad.Sanju Samson, who underwent surgery for a right index finger fracture sustained during the home T20I series against England, is also nearing a return.

In the past few years, Bumrah has faced several ups and downs due to persistent injuries. The premier pacer has already missed a few major events due to his back injuries, including the 2022 T20 World Cup, the 2023 World Test Championship Final, and the 2025 Champions Trophy.The 31-year-old sustained a back injury during the final Test of Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25 as he was not available to bowl for India in the second innings at SCG, and Australia won the match to reclaim the coveted trophy after a decade.McGrath asserted that Bumrah had found ways to manage the stress he has put on his body in the past few occasions, but he still needs to be smarter to avoid the persistent injuries.\u201cHe puts more stress on his body than the other bowlers. He has found ways to manage it, but unfortunately not all the time. He has done it before (making a comeback from injury), he will know better than anyone (about) the recovery time, the time in the gym. He is not as young as he used to be, so he has to be smarter about what he does,\u201d McGrath told Times of India.McGrath further elaborated and compared fast bowling to driving a car and said Bumrah needs to fuel up by working harder off the field.\u201cHe has to work even harder off the field. Being a fast bowler is like driving a car. If you do not top it up with fuel, you are going to run out of fuel sooner or later. My fuel tank was bigger than Jasprit\u2019s because I did not bowl as quickly as him. These guys know how they work at their best. If India are under the pump, they need him,\u201d he added.Bumrah likely to miss initial phase of IPL 2025Meanwhile, the 31-year-old is likely to miss the initial rounds of the IPL 2025 matches for Mumbai Indians as the star pacer is still recovering from the lower back injury.

    "rawdes": "Ramzan is a special time for actor Taher Shabbir, not only because of the festivities but because it gives him the opportunity to give back through his restaurant in Mumbai. As we reach there at midnight, the place is jam-packed and Taher Shabbir is just busy going at every table and making sure every customer is well-fed as he treats them all like family.As we ask him about this holy month\u2019s influence on him, the actor says, \u201cRamzan means the world to me as spiritually, it keeps you grounded. People think the rozas are for only one month, but it actually makes you inculcate a habit of being good and kind through the year. You don\u2019t say or see anything bad, and you are trying to the be the best version of yourself.\u201dTaher is like a completely different person at his restaurant, just dedicated to serving the people that have come with not only food, but warmth and love as well. \u201cSince I was six, my father would bring me and my brother here to do seva. We would be the waiter and it was all about giving and taking blessings for that. At that young age, it was about giving food, but as I grew up, I realised my father\u2019s intention was never about just feeding people, it was about selling sweetness and making people happy,\u201d he shares.The actor adds, \u201cMere abba mithai nahi mithaas baat rahe the, wo khushiyan baat rahe the. And Ramzan is the beginning of the year for me to start believing in that again and keep at it for the rest of the year. Even after being in the film industry for so many years, I just can\u2019t seem to leave this part of me behind.\u201dAs the customers gather around him to take pictures, Taher acknowledges each and every request. Ask him if it feels gratifying getting to interact with them personally and he says, \u201cHonestly, when people come and click photos with me, it is not as gratifying as when I get to feed them and see the happiness in their eyes. Even as an actor, the fame was never my game, all I want is to make people happy.\u201d Taher adds that his father had seen a lot of trouble and after he passed away, his lookout towards his family business changed. \u201cAfter we lost him, me and my brother made it a mission that his legacy of spreading happiness keeps going.\u201dAs he feeds so many people, does he enjoy cooking too during Ramzan? \u201cWhat many people don't know is that I have been a president scout. So, I used to cook for 200-300 scouts every day at camp. But when I am at home, I like to relax. And not only me, I also don\u2019t follow the gender stereotypes. I have this rule that a woman at our home will go into the kitchen only when the man is going too,\u201d he responds, sharing some of his favourite delicacies during Ramzan: \u201cI really enjoy bheja gurda, naan chaap sandwich, chicken cheese baida roti. I also love Nihari and Bawda, and the Nihari recipe that we have is my friend (actor) Dia Mirza approved. During Ramzan, I am only eating malpua, dipping it in malai and rabri. I also have two types of phirni I love\u2014the classic rose one and the kesar phirni. There is also malai khaja.\u201dTaher feels festivals are all about unity and community, and he insists that it shouldn\u2019t be restricted to just one section. \u201cRamzan is as much of Hindus as it is for Muslims, and similarly Diwali is as much of Muslims as it is for Hindus. I love the unity that festivals bring, and I feel that should never get divided on the basis of religion, caste or creed. Let\u2019s love each other like no generation before us has loved and make the biggest change that India will ever see,\u201d he ends. ",

He made the mention as he expressed his desire to present a clean and safe image of Washington DC to visiting world leaders, including Prime Minister Modi, talking about the importance of removing tents and graffiti near federal buildings. \"When Prime Minister Modi of India, the President of France, and all of these people\u2026 Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, they all came to see me over the last week and a half. And when they come in\u2026I had the route run. I didn't want to have them see tents. I didn't want to have them see graffiti. I didn't want to have them see broken barriers and potholes in the roads. And we had it looking beautiful,\" Trump said. While delivering his remarks, Trump outlined plans for city improvement, highlighting efforts to eliminate crime, remove graffiti and dismantle tents in collaboration with the administration. \"We're cleaning up our city. We're cleaning up this great capital, and we're not going to have crime, and we're not going to stand for crime, and we're going to take the graffiti down, and we're already taking the tents down, and we're working with the administration,\" also said Trump. He acknowledged Mayor Muriel Bowser's effective efforts in cleaning the capital, noting the swift removal of tents located opposite the State Department. \"We said there are tents galore right opposite the State Department. They have to come down. And they took them down right away. And so so far, so good. We want to have a capital that can be the talk of the world,\" the US President added to his statement. The President committed to transforming Washington DC into a crime-free capital where visitors would feel secure without fears of mugging, shooting or assault. \"We're going to have a crime-free capital. When people come here, they're not going to be mugged or shot or raped. They're going to have a crime-free capital, again, it's going to be cleaner and better and safer than it ever was and it's not going to take us too long,\" said Trump. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i41Av4eYO8 PM Modi's White House visit for bilateral discussions occurred on February 13, making him the fourth international leader to meet Trump following his January inauguration. In the initial month of Trump's second term, he welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Jordan's King Abdullah II. The US President's recent diplomatic engagements also included meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer amongst other foreign leaders during his second term. Meanwhile, during his DOJ speech, Trump also took a jab at former President Joe Biden. He criticised Biden's administration, stating that they had transformed the Department of Justice (DOJ) into a \"Department of Injustice\". Trump delivered these comments at the Department of Justice after numerous Biden-era judges, attorneys and officials were either dismissed or resigned under the current administration. Speaking as the Chief Law Enforcement Officer, Trump declared that the previous administration's approach to justice had ended permanently. \"Our predecessor turned the Department of Justice into a Department of Injustice, but I stand before you to declare that those days are over, and they are never coming back. And now, as the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of our country, I will insist upon and demand accountability for all the wrongs and abuse that have occurred,\" Trump said. Trump alleged that investigators had conducted surveillance on his campaign and initiated multiple hoax and disinformation operations.

Tesla India Motor & Energy Pvt. Ltd., the local unit of Musk's firm, submitted two new applications for homologation of the Model Y and Model 3 cars in India, according to industry sources. Homologation is the process of certifying that a vehicle is roadworthy and meets the norms laid out for all vehicles manufactured in India or imported into the country. The tests ensure that the vehicle matches the requirements of the Indian market in terms of emission, safety, and roadworthiness in accordance with the Central Motor Vehicle Rules. The company earlier submitted seven applications for homologation in India, which were meant for test cars. An eighth application was approved recently. The move comes amid talks with the US and India on a free trade agreement under which tariffs are expected to be lowered by both countries to enhance bilateral trade. Musk is keen to enter India as he looks for a foothold in the world's third-largest car market as an alternative to China, after the communist country came under strict US sanctions. While the Indian govt is keen for Musk to set up a plant in India to make Tesla for the local market, the billionaire wants to export the car to the country without any immediate manufacturing plans. Electric car sales in India recorded a 20% jump to 99,165 units in 2024, from 82,688 units in 2023. Tata Motors and JSW MG Motors are currently the market leaders.

According to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), the electric passenger vehicle retail sales in India grew by nearly 20%. The EV market is expected to continue growing, with industry forecasts predicting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 43%. Govt initiatives and subsidies under the PM E-Drive scheme are also contributing to the growth of the EV market in India, as the country transitions to green energy in the fight against climate change. The electric two-wheeler segment recorded significant growth, with 1.13 million units sold in 2024, up from 860,000 units in 2023.

Marking the special day, Sanjana shared a touching message featuring song lyrics that encapsulated her deep bond with the Indian pace spearhead. Sanjana marked her fourth wedding anniversary with Jasprit Bumrah by sharing heartfelt lyrics from the song \"Tu Hai Toh\" on Instagram. \"Tu hai toh dil dhadakta hai/Tu na toh ghar ghar nahi lagta/Tu hai to darr nahi lagta/Happy 4,\" wrote Bumrah's wife. The couple, who tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Goa in 2021, welcomed their son, Angad, on September 4, 2023. While the celebration was all about love and togetherness, Bumrah\u2019s absence from the field has been a topic of discussion. The Mumbai Indians pacer has been recovering from a lower back injury sustained during the fifth Test against Australia in January. The injury sidelined him from bowling in the second innings of the Sydney Test, which India lost by six wickets. As a result, Bumrah also missed India\u2019s victorious Champions Trophy campaign, where the Men in Blue lifted the title without their premier fast bowler. His absence was a major blow, but the team management opted to give him ample time to recover, with an eye on the upcoming Test series against England in June. \"His recuperation is going well. But at this stage, it\u2019s better to give him more time to return to peak fitness,\" a source told PTI. The BCCI medical team has not provided a definitive timeline for his return, but he has been gradually increasing his workload in the nets. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar had earlier advised five weeks of \"off-loading\" to manage stress on his back, considering his history of similar injuries. With IPL 2025 around the corner, Mumbai Indians will be hoping for Bumrah\u2019s return, especially after their disappointing tenth-place finish last season.

    "rawdes": "NEW DELHI: A Bengaluru Special Court for Economic Offences has reserved its verdict on Kannada actress Ranya Rao\u2019s bail plea in the gold smuggling case, with the judgment expected on March 14. During the hearing, Senior Advocate Kiran Javali, representing Rao, argued that the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) failed to follow due legal procedures during her arrest and questioning. He claimed the arrest memo did not explicitly mention the \"grounds of arrest,\" violating the Supreme Court's DK Basu guidelines. Javali contended that such lapses warrant bail, irrespective of the severity of the allegations. The DRI, opposing the bail, emphasized the gravity of the charges against Rao, who was arrested at Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport on March 3 with 14 kg of gold. Prosecutors argued that releasing her could disrupt the ongoing investigation and lead to evidence tampering or witness intimidation. Ranya Rao has alleged mistreatment during her detention, claiming DRI officials verbally abused her and pressured her into signing documents without proper consent. The DRI, however, dismissed these claims, asserting that all protocols were followed lawfully. The agency also revealed that Rao had managed to clear immigration and the Green Channel with assistance from the State Protocol Office before being intercepted just outside the airport exit. This has raised serious concerns over the involvement of state officials in the smuggling racket. Meanwhile, a fresh controversy erupted after the Karnataka government withdrew its approval for a CID probe into the alleged police escort provided to Rao at the airport. Sources suggest the abrupt U-turn came under pressure from influential circles, fearing revelations from a police constable who was intercepted while escorting Rao could implicate senior officials. The state home department defended the move, stating that a separate probe led by senior IAS officer and Additional Chief Secretary Gaurav Gupta was already underway to examine the role of the state protocol wing and DGP Ramachandra Rao, Ranya\u2019s father. Basavaraj, a head constable from the airport police station, told the CBI on Tuesday that he had merely followed \"oral instructions from senior IPS officers\" regarding receiving and dropping off their family members at the airport. However, he denied any knowledge of the gold smuggling. Investigators are now probing who exactly ordered Basavaraj to escort Rao during her travels. The CBI has already questioned Basavaraj and two other officials in an attempt to reconstruct the events leading up to Rao\u2019s arrest. Sources indicate that the actress had directly contacted the constable before her arrival from Dubai, suggesting a prior arrangement. Public prosecutor Madhu N Rao, representing the DRI, reiterated the agency\u2019s firm stance against granting bail. \u201cWe oppose the bail petition since it is a matter of national security. The accused is not cooperating with us. The incident indicates that an established syndicate is working behind (gold smuggling), and we have to investigate the hawala angle, too,\u201d he said. The DRI has also summoned the protocol officer who allegedly assisted Rao. Additionally, the agency revealed that the actress holds a UAE resident identity card, adding another layer to the investigation.",

    "rawdes": "BENGALURU: A video of a doctor and her children purportedly assaulting her aged in-laws over a marital dispute went viral Thursday, sparking outrage on social media with netizens demanding stern action against her. Annapoorneshwarinagar police registered a case against Dr Priyadarshini N, who practices at Victoria Hospital in the city, based on a complaint filed by her father-in-law J Narasimaiah, a resident of RHCS Layout in west Bengaluru. According to him, his son Naveen Kumar, also a doctor, married Priyadarshini in 2007 but they applied for a divorce. She visited Narasimaiah's home around 8:30pm on March 10 along with her daughter and son. She abused him, his wife, and Naveen and allegedly issued death threats. She manhandled them and assaulted Narasimaiah on his head and back. He requested police to take action against her. A senior officer said a case has been registered under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) sections 115 (voluntarily causing hurt), 126 (wrongful restraint), 351 (criminal intimidation), and 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace). Since the offences are bailable, her statement will be taken, and a chargesheet will be filed based on the evidence. According to police, the dispute in the family has been ongoing for many years. Priyadarshini claims she visited her husband's home to question him about not taking financial responsibility for their children. She claimed her in-laws provoked her and her children. When she and her children lost patience and reacted, they recorded the video. However, the accusations of both the complainant and the suspects are being verified, the officer added. In the video, Priyadarshini can be seen shouting at people recording the video on their mobiles, dragging her mother-in-law by her hair, and her daughter kicking her grandmother. However, according to a post on X by a handler who uploaded the video, Priyadarshini harassed her in-laws for over a decade. Her mistreatment forced them to leave their own house and live in a rented home. A court ruled that she had no right to visit them, yet on March 10, she and her two children forcibly entered their home and assaulted them. Her father-in-law is a heart patient, and his wife is a survivor of a chronic disease. Priyadarshini has not put out any statement in this regard.",

    "rawdes": "The festival of Holi brought colours of joy and box office success for Bollywood star John Abraham! The actor, highly loved for his action movies, made it to the theatres this Friday with \u2018The Diplomat,\u2019 a thriller based on true events. This Shivam Nair directorial chronicles the ordeal of an Indian girl Uzma Ahmed, played by Sadia Khateeb, who gets trapped in Pakistan after being deceived into marriage. John Abraham essays the role of J.P. Singh, the Indian diplomat who plays a crucial part in her rescue. Early predictions regarding the box office collection of the movie hinted at a slow start but \u2018The Diplomat\u2019 proved them wrong and had a decent opening at the box office. The Diplomat Movie Review According to the Sacnilk report, the movie opened with Rs.4 crore on March 14, 2025. The festival of Holi may have helped it have a solid start at the box office. With the weekend ahead, the movie is expected to see substantial growth. Also, it is worth noting that \u2018The Diplomat\u2019 made a decent opening despite facing a challenge from Vicky Kaushal\u2019s \u2018Chhaava.\u2019 This Laxman Utekar movie has been reigning at the box office since day 1, and now after a month, it made Rs 7.25 Crore on the fifth Friday of release (March 14). Considering these numbers, it would not be wrong to say that \u2018The Diplomat\u2019 has come up as a solid second choice for cinephiles. Further, if we look at the occupancy rate, on March 14, \u2018The Diplomat\u2019 recorded a footfall of 20.45%. The morning shows saw an occupancy of 7.31%, which rose to 19.42% in the afternoon. The percentage further increased, with the evening show witnessing an occupancy rate of 28.50%. It went slightly down in the night shows, with 26.56% occupancy. The maximum occupancy was seen in Chennai - 75.33%. The second best was seen in Bhopal with 29.50%, and Kolkata with 29% followed closely behind. ETimes review for the movie reads, \"John Abraham delivers one of his most nuanced performances as the empathetic and resolute diplomat. He balances quiet authority with wry humour, particularly in moments where he subtly challenges Pakistani officials. \"Yeh Pakistan hai, beta, yahan aadmi aur ghoda seedhi chaal nahi chalta,\" offers a refreshing break from the usual jingoistic rhetoric. Sadia Khateeb portrays Uzma\u2019s vulnerability and resilience with finesse, while Revathy channels the late Sushma Swaraj\u2019s kindness and strength with conviction. Kumud Mishra stands out as Uzma\u2019s sharp yet warm-hearted lawyer, and Jagjeet Sandhu impresses as the deceptively charming yet terrifying Tahir.\"",

Officials announced on Friday that this measure aims to prevent rumour-mongering and illegal activities. The suspension remains active from March 14 (Friday) through March 17 (Monday). The Principal Secretary of Home and Hill Affairs Department, West Bengal Government, issued the directive on March 14, citing worries about potential rumour-spreading that could lead to unlawful activities. Law enforcement personnel have been positioned in the affected localities following reports of stone-pelting incidents in Birbhum. The official directive states: \"Any data related message or class of message to or from any person or class of persons, to or from any telecommunication equipment or class of telecommunication equipment, or relating to any particular subject, brought for transmission by, or transmitted or received by any telecommunication service or telecommunication network under the ambit of Telecommunications Act, 2023, shall temporarily not be transmitted in the interest of maintaining public order and preventing incitement to the commission of any offence.\" The directive clarifies that voice calls and SMS services remain unaffected. Additionally, newspaper circulation continues normally, ensuring that \"communication and dissemination of knowledge and information is not stopped in any way.\" The affected areas include Sainthia, Hatora Gram Panchayat (GP), Mathpalsa GP, Harisara GP, Dariyapur GP, and Fulur GP. The order specifies: \"In view of the recent events in some areas, Internet transmissions and voice over internet telephony maybe used for spreading rumour for unlawful activities in geographical area of Sainthia town area of Sainthia Municipality, Hatora GP, Mathpalsa GP, Harisara GO, Fariyapur GP and Fulur GP area under Sainthia police station of Sainthia community development block in Birbhum Revenue district, under Birbhum police district over the next dfew days and hence the service may be temporarily shut down.\" The restrictions took effect immediately on March 14 and will continue until 8am of March 17. Union minister and West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar on Saturday criticised the Mamata Banerjee-led state government over the reported clash in Birbhum, accusing the state police of being \"defunct\" and lacking professionalism. Speaking to ANI, Majumdar said, \"We have witnessed such incidents in Birbhum before. Previously, a TMC leader was caught with gelatin sticks, and an NIA inquiry is ongoing. The Mamata Banerjee government has turned Birbhum into a blast factory.\" He also alleged that a significant quantity of explosive material had been seized in Kolkata earlier, with security agencies recovering over 1,000 kg of ammonium nitrate\u2014while the city police remained unaware. \"The West Bengal police have become defunct. They have been politicized to such an extent that they have lost their professionalism and effectiveness,\" Majumdar claimed, blaming the state administration for failing to maintain law and order.",

The Laxman Utekar directorial \u2018Chaava\u2019 saw some drop in the business in its 4th week; however, with the Holi, which marked its fifth Friday, the movie gained back the momentum and showed a rise of more than 60 percent. According to Sacnilk report, the movie made around Rs. 7.25 Cr (Hindi: Rs 6.5 Cr; Telugu: Rs 0.75 Cr) on its fifth Friday, taking the film\u2019s total to Rs 546.75 Cr (Hindi: Rs. 534.45 Cr; Telugu: Rs 12.55 Cr).

The opening weekend and the entire first week recorded some impressive numbers. By the end of week 1, the movie stood at Rs.219.25 Cr. The second week maintained a momentum of Rs.180.25 Cr collection. However, the numbers started dropping from week 3 and saw a major dip in week 4. Nevertheless, the start of the fifth week promises a better collection, especially with the weekend ahead.

Vicky Kaushal is breathtaking as he exudes Sambhaji Maharaj\u2019s valour and passion for swarajya (self-rule) like it were his second skin.

    "rawdes": "NAGPUR: Former Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole on Friday added political colour to Holi hue with a bold invite to deputy chief ministers Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar to form a govt without CM Devendra Fadnavis, if they face suffocated under his leadership. Taking a swipe at the state\u2019s ruling alliance while delivering Holi greetings in Nagpur, Patole suggested Congress is willing to collaborate with Shinde and Pawar if tensions with Fadnavis escalate. \u201cIf Devendra Fadnavis is troubling you, we are ready to stand with you and form a govt together,\u201d he declared, signalling a potential shift in Maharashtra\u2019s political landscape. Talking to TOI, Patole said, the statement was made in a lighter vein for Holi. \u201cI made a statement telling them Bura Na Mano Holi Hai. However, if Shinde and Ajit Pawar want to come, we will embrace them,\u201d he said. State Congress president Harshvardhan Sapkal refused to elaborate on Patole\u2019s statement or answer TOI\u2019s query on whether he was on the same page with the former state party chief. \u201cBurra na mano Holi hai. I won\u2019t speak further,\u201d he told TOI. Speaking to the news channel, Patole criticized Shinde and Pawar for allegedly altering their political approach since aligning with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \u201cEarlier, these two leaders prioritized Maharashtra\u2019s development and collaborated across party lines. But after coming under Modi\u2019s influence, they\u2019ve started exaggerating and distorting facts,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI urge them to spurn negativity and focus on welfare of the people,\u201d he added. The offer comes amidst reports of friction between Fadnavis and his two deputies, fuelling speculation about cracks within the tripartite Maharashtra government. Not sparing the chief minister, Patole accused Fadnavis of misleading the public with false claims. \u201cMy friend Fadnavis has been lying a lot lately. I hope he stops spreading falsehoods and focuses on real issues,\u201d he quipped. Responding to rumours of internal rifts within Congress, Patole asserted the party remains united and ticket distribution for upcoming elections was handled amicably. He specifically praised senior Congress leader Vijay Wadettiwar, calling him \u201csuperfast\u201d and encouraging him to accelerate his political efforts. Responding to Patole's comments, BJP state president Chandrashekhar Bawankule told TOI that Patole should look within. \u201cMaharashtra\u2019s citizens have given a massive mandate to Mahayuti. Patole himself scraped through to win his Sakoli seat. He should strengthen his own party first and play the role of a responsible opposition party,\u201d he said. In a rare display of appreciation across party lines, Patole commended Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut as an \u201cintellectual powerhouse\u201d whose wisdom continues to shape the state\u2019s political discourse. He also acknowledged former Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray as a guiding figure, reinforcing the long-standing political ties between Congress and the Sena faction. Patole's open offer to Shinde and Pawar not only highlights increasing tensions within Maharashtra govt, but also signals Congress\u2019 readiness to play a decisive role if the state\u2019s political equation changes.

Harish added that that Pakistan's repeated mentions would \"neither validate their claim nor justify their practice of cross-border terrorism\". \"The fanatical mindset of this nation is well known, as also its record of bigotry. Such efforts will not change the reality that Jammu and Kashmir was, is and will always be an integral part of India,\" he declared. This forceful response followed Pakistan's former foreign secretary, Tehmina Janjua's references to Jammu and Kashmir during the informal gathering commemorating the International Day to Combat Islamophobia. The Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations shared further details on the ambassador \"delivering India's statement\". Talking about Islamophobia, Harish added to his statement, \"India stands united with the UN membership in condemning incidents of religious intolerance against Muslims.\" \"It is imperative to recognize that religious discrimination is a broader challenge that affects followers of all faiths,\" also said P Harish adding that, \"Any deliberation on issues of faith must seek to unite , not divide.\" India's criticism on Pakistan at the UN comes after Pakistan suggested India's involvement in the recent train hijacking in Balochistan, to which the ministry of external affairs (MEA) released a statement, rejecting 'baseless allegations' and asked their neighbour to look inwards for 'its own internal problems.' MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal responded to media queries regarding remarks made by the Pakistan side, saying, \"We strongly reject the baseless allegations made by Pakistan. The whole world knows where the epicenter of global terrorism lies. Pakistan should look inwards instead of pointing fingers and shifting the blame for its own internal problems and failures on to others.\" Read more: MEA rejects Pakistan\u2019s claim of India's role in train hijacking The attack on the Jaffar Express on March 11, which was carrying more than 450 passengers, led to 58 deaths, comprising 21 passengers, four soldiers, and 33 militants belonging to the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist group. Pakistan regularly claims that India provides support to organisations such as the BLA to foment instability in Balochistan, charges that New Delhi categorically rejects.",
